# Generate isochrones

With isochrones, you can view where you can travel from a point, such as a transit stop, within a certain amount of time. You can specify the mode of transportation, such as walking, biking, driving, or taking transit, and see a series of rings to represent various increments of time from 15 to 60 minutes. This functionality is sometimes referred to as drive-time analysis, service areas, or walking walksheds, which is adapted from the spatial analysis term, viewshed, that indicates how much you can see from a point.

1. Search for a place in the box or click a location on the map.
2. To view the distances you can travel from the stop location, click a mode of transportation. For example, click `walking` to see how far you can walk within intervals of 15 to 60 minutes. If you choose to travel by transit, you need to set the date and time of your departure.
3. Move the point around the map to calculate isochrones from that location.
4. If you want to see the JSON that is being returned from the Mapzen Mobility API, click the link to see the request.
5. Click the clear button on the search box to remove the pin and isochrones from the map.
