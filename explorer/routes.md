# Explore transit routes

Mobility Explorer starts with a default view of transit data.

1. Search for a place in the box on the map or pan and zoom to find your area of interest.
2. Click `Show routes` to display routes on the map. The map updates to show transit route lines.
3. Hover over a line on the map to get a preview of more information about it.
4. Choose whether to display the lines by the type of transportation mode, such as bus or metro (subway), or the agency that operates the route.
5. To filter the map by a single route or operator, click it on the map or in the drop-down list. 
6. Check `Show stops served by route` to view the transit stops along the route.
  The route line and stops that are displayed by default are a representation of the most common shape of that route. However, a route may be different at certain times, for example, in inbound or return directions, or to consider one-way roads. These differences are known as a RouteStopPattern in the Transitland API.
7. Click `Show route stop patterns` and a value to view the each unique combination of shape lines for trips and stops along this route.
  If you are also showing the stops, the stops are colored based on whether they are served by any stop along the route or only that particular RouteStopPattern.
