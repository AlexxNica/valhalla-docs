# Mobility Explorer

You can use Mobility Explorer to learn about multimodal transportation around the world. Search for a place or browse the map, and use the buttons to view transit routes, stops, and operators. Mobility Explorer integrates open transit data from Transitland and transportation inquiry services from Mapzen.

Each time you use the buttons on Mobility Explorer to update the map, you are constructing a query to the Transitland database. The address bar in your browser updates with the URL of the query you are sending to Transitland. Each query is also maintained as a separate URL, which means that you can go back to your previous map by clicking the Back button in your browser.

Mobility Explorer also integrates Mapzen Mobility services, including isochrones. With isochrones, you can view where you can travel from a point, such as a transit stop, within a certain amount of time. You can specify the mode of transportation, such as walking, biking, driving, or taking transit, and see a series of rings to represent various increments of time from 15 to 60 minutes. This functionality is sometimes referred to as drive-time analysis, service areas, or walking walksheds, which is adapted from the spatial analysis term, viewshed, that indicates how much you can see from a point.
