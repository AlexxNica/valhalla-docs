# Mobility Explorer

Mobility Explorer helps you understand transportation networks around the world. Search for a place or browse the map, and use the buttons to view transit routes, stops, and operators.

Use Mobility Explorer to query and visualize the combination of transit data from Transitland, a community-edited, open transit data aggregation project that Mapzen sponsors, and Mapzen Mobility, which provides routing and navigation tools for walking, bicycling, driving, and taking public transit.
