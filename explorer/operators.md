# Explore operators

1. Search for a place in the box on the map or pan and zoom to find your area of interest.
2. Click `Show operators` to display the areas served by transit operators on the map. These polygons are created by connecting a line for the minimum bounding area of the extent of the routes and stops for that operator.
3. Hover over a polygon on the map to get a preview of more information about it.
4. To filter the map by a single operator, click it on the map or in the drop-down list. Because the polygons may overlap in areas with multiple operators, it may be easier to choose the operator by name from the list.
5. From the details panel, you can see which routes and stops are served by this operator. Viewing the routes and stops takes you to a query for `Show routes` or `Show stops`, respectively. You can click your browser's Back button to return to your operators query.
