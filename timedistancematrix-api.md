# Valhalla Time Distance Matrix Service API Reference

The time distance matrix service is a free, open-source web API (and c++ library) that provides a quick computation of time and distance between a set of locations. This page documents the inputs and outputs to the service.

The time distance matrix service is in active development. You can follow the [Mapzen blog](https://mapzen.com/blog) to get updates. To report software issues or suggest enhancements, open an issue in the [Thor GitHub repository](https://github.com/valhalla/thor/issues). You can also send a message to [routing@mapzen.com](mailto:routing@mapzen.com).
	
#### API keys and Service Limits

To use the Valhalla routing service, you must first obtain a free developer API key from Mapzen. Sign in at https://mapzen.com/developers to create and manage your API keys.

Valhalla is a free, shared routing service. As such, there are limitations on requests, maximum distances, and numbers of locations to prevent individual users from degrading the overall system performance.

The following time and distance limitations that are currently in place:

* 'max_locations' is currently set to 50 for `one_to_many`, `many_to_one` and 'many_to_many' requests.
* `max_distance` is the maximum "crow-flies" distance between two locations and is currently set to 200000.0 meters (200.0 km) for all matrix types. For `one_to_many` the distance between the first location and any of the others cannot exceed the maximum. For `many_to_one` the distance between the last location and any of the others cannot exceed the maximum. Finally, for `many_to_many` the distance between any pair of locations cannot exceed the maximum.

Please also refer to the [Valhalla API Limits](https://mapzen.com/documentation/valhalla/api-reference/#api-keys-and-service-limits) to view the current routing limitations that are in place.

Limits may be increased in the future, but you can contact routing@mapzen.com if you encounter rate limit status messages and need higher limits in the meantime.

#### Request Actions/Methods

We currently provide three time distance matrix actions, '/one_to_many?', '/many_to_one?' and '/many_to_many?' that can be requested from the Time Distance Matrix Service.  These actions can compute three different types of matrices, either a row matrix for a "one_to_many", a column matrix for a "many_to_one" or a square matrix for a "many_to_many".  

In the future, we may also provide a second action, '/weight?'.

| Matrix Type | Description |
| :--------- | :----------- |
| `one_to_many` | To return a row vector of computed time and distance from the first (origin) location to each additional location provided. This means that the first element in the row vector computed time and distance will be [0,0.00]. |
| `many_to_one` | To return a column vector of computed time and distance from each location to the last (destination) location provided. This means that the last element in the row vector computed time and distance will be [0,0.00]. |
| `many_to_many`| To return a square matrix of computed time and distance from each location to every other location.  This means that the main diagonal of the square matrix will be [0,0.00] all the way through.  |


#### Input for the Time Distance Matrix API

An example request takes the form of `matrix.mapzen.com/one_to_many?json={}&api_key=`, where the JSON inputs inside the ``{}`` include an array of at least 2 locations and options for the costing model.

Here is an example time distance matrix request using pedestrian costing:

From the office, I want to know the times and distances to each restaurant location for dinner, as well as the times and distances from each restaraunt to the train station for my journey home.  This will help me determine where I want to eat.

    matrix.mapzen.com/many_to_many?json={"locations":[{"lat":40.744014,"lon":-73.990508},{"lat":40.739735,"lon":-73.979713},{"lat":40.752522,"lon":-73.985015},{"lat":40.750117,"lon":-73.983704},{"lat":40.750552,"lon":-73.993519}],"costing":"pedestrian"}&api_key=valhalla-xxxxxx
    

Note that you must append your own [Valhalla API key](https://mapzen.com/developers) to the URL, following `&api_key=` at the end.

#### Input Parameters

A location must include a latitude and longitude in decimal degrees. The coordinates can come from many input sources, such as a GPS location, a point or a click on a map, a geocoding service, and so on. External search services, such as [Pelias](https://github.com/pelias) or [Nominatum](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim), can be used to find places and geocode addresses, whose coordinates can be used as input to the Time Distance service.

| Location parameters | Description |
| :--------- | :----------- |
| `lat` | Latitude of the location in degrees. |
| `lon` | Longitude of the location in degrees. |

Please also refer to the [Valhalla API Locations](https://mapzen.com/documentation/valhalla/api-reference/#locations) to view the full detail on Locations.

#### Costing

Please refer to the [Valhalla API Costing Models](https://mapzen.com/documentation/valhalla/api-reference/#costing-models) and [Costing Options](https://mapzen.com/documentation/valhalla/api-reference/#costing-options) to view the costing that is in place.

#### Output

The matrix results are returned with.

| Item | Description |
| :---- | :----------- |
| `one_to_many` | This will return a row vector (1 x n) of computed time and distance from the first (origin) location to each additional location. |
| `many_to_one` | This will return a column vector (n X 1) of computed time and distance from each location provided to the last (destination) location. |
| `many_to_many` | This will return a square matrix (n x n) of an array of computed time and distance from each location to every other location. |
| `distance` | The computed distance between each set of points. Distance will always be 0.00 for the first element of the time distance array for `one_to_many`, the last element in a `many_to_one`, and the first and last elements of a `many_to_many`. |
| `time` | The computed time between each set of points. Time will always be 0 for the first element of the time distance array for `one_to_many`, the last element in a `many_to_one`, and the first and last elements of a `many_to_many`.  |
| `to_index` | The destination index into the locations array. |
| `from_index` | The origin index into the locations array. |
| `locations` | The specified array of lat/lngs from the input request.
| `units` | Distance units for output. Allowable unit types are mi (miles) and km (kilometers). If no unit type is specified, the units default to kilometers. |
